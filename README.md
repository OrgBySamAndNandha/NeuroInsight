# üß† NeuroInsight

**AI-powered Alzheimer‚Äôs MRI Analysis and Doctor-Patient Collaboration Platform**

---

## üìñ Abstract

**NeuroInsight** is an innovative healthcare application that harnesses deep learning for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease from brain MRI scans. The app analyzes uploaded MRI images using a deep learning model to provide an initial prediction report. This report, along with the original MRI scan, is sent to a connected neurologist for further analysis, recommendations, or appointment scheduling. Both the AI and doctor‚Äôs reports are then processed and formatted by an integrated AI assistant, which stores and organizes all results for easy access. Patients can interact with the AI bot to ask questions, receive insights, and track their health journey. Monthly analytics and visualizations help patients understand changes and progress over time.

## üí° Problem Statement

Early diagnosis and continuous monitoring are critical in managing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, but access to expert analysis and organized medical records remains a challenge for many patients. Traditional methods rely heavily on in-person appointments, manual reporting, and lack digital tracking, leading to delayed interventions, confusion over medical records, and limited patient engagement in their own care.

## üìù Abstract

NeuroInsight addresses these limitations by combining automated deep learning-based MRI analysis, doctor collaboration, intelligent report formatting, and interactive AI-driven patient support. The platform simplifies the diagnosis process, improves record-keeping, and empowers patients to track and understand their neurological health using clear analytics and easy-to-use conversational interfaces.
